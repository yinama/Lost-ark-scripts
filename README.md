### 1. Auto press G

Like what it says, just keeps pressing g<br>

### 2. Auto Mine

Works in Meteora, will find and mine everything within the screen

### 3. Auto Log

Doesn't work so well yet, intended for Giant Mushroom Island.  Go on to the island, go a little bit left and then down.  Go near the tree at bottom left and run the command(not tested yet)

### 4. Auto Fish

Should work on any map, after running the script, keep the skill tab to Trade skills, assign fish skill to 'e', hover mouse to the fish location(make sure lost ark is the active window)
